## Installation

#### 1. Using pipx (recommended)

pipx is a great tool for installing Python applications in isolated environments, so you don‚Äôt clutter your global Python installation.

To install pipx:
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

After you have pipx installed, you can install nag:

```bash
pipx install nag
```

This will install nag and ensure it‚Äôs available globally on your system.

#### 2. Using pip

You can also install nag using pip if you prefer to install it directly into your Python environment.

```bash
pip install nag
```

## Usage

#### 1. Adding a Time Block

To add a new task to your schedule:

```bash
nag block 09:00 10:00 "Meeting with team"
```

This will add a task from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM with the description "Meeting with team" for today by default. You can also specify a date:

```bash
nag block 09:00 10:00 "Meeting with team" --task-date 09/19
```

#### 2. Annotating a task

To annotate an existing task using its ID (as shown in the timeline):

```bash
nag annotate <task_id> "Discussed project progress."
```

#### 3. Showing your schedule

To view your schedule for today:

```bash
nag show
```

You can also show the schedule for a specific date:

```bash
nag show --date 09/19
```
